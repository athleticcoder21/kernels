## The question

Inference optimization is not magic. Every performance result is a consequence
of computation, memory traffic, communication, and how an algorithm maps onto
the hardware underneath it.

This book develops a practical way to answer one question:

> What is stopping this workload from going faster—compute, memory,
> communication, or the way it is mapped onto the GPU?

Each chapter starts with a model of the work, follows it with a runnable
implementation, and then uses measurements to challenge that model. The code
lives beside the writing so the reasoning can be inspected and reproduced.

## How the book grows

The structure moves from a single GPU outward:

1. **Kernels** — memory layout, warp execution, tiling, and reductions.
2. **Transformer inference** — attention, MLPs, prefill, decode, and KV caches.
3. **Serving systems** — batching, scheduling, quantization, and latency versus throughput.
4. **Scaling out** — parallelism, communication, and fleet-level efficiency.

Only finished chapters appear in the navigation. Start with
[Part 1: Making GEMV Fast](gemv).
